        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p class="indent">
           Fossilstan is the first story in chronological order within the Mathscots Lore Universe. 
           The story is about Pterry, a lonely young pterodactyl abandoned by his family, who struggles to survive until he unexpectedly befriends an energetic T-rex name Tyra. 
           Their bond quickly becomes the first true friendship Pterry has ever known, but everything changes when a mysterious glowing toy Tyra gives him seems to erase her memories of him overnight. 
           Heartbroken, Pterry searches for her for months, only to find she genuinely doesn’t remember him, and he flees into a storm, devastated. 
           The same magical toy later restores Tyra’s memories, prompting her to chase after him—unaware that Pterry has been captured by strange alien creatures seeking a powerful object they believe he possesses.</p>
