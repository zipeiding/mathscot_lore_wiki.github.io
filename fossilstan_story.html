        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p class="indent">
            After being abandoned by his migrating family, Pterry, a young pterodactyl, struggles to survive alone until he unexpectedly befriends Tyra, an unusually kind and talkative T-rex who gives him a magical armadillo toy. 
            When the toy mysteriously causes Tyra to lose all memory of him, Pterry searches for her for months, only to be devastated when she truly no longer recognizes him and he is soon after captured by two time-traveling entities seeking a powerful device. 
            Tyra later regains her memories through the same toy and joins forces with Pterry, her family, and the cylinders to confront a dangerous Xenotarsosaurus who has seized the device and begun using its destructive power. 
            After a violent battle that costs Tyra’s mother her life, the group defeats the monster and returns the device to the cylinders, who then attempt to save their future world; just as a catastrophic meteor event reshapes the surface of Fossilstan, while Pterry and Tyra survive safely underground.
